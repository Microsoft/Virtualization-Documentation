# TODO

This file lists the things we'd like to get done.  Some of it is stuff we're working on and some of it is stuff anyone in the community could help with.

## Minor Fixes
* Spelling, grammar, review
* Containers Work in Progress and Known Issues pages
  * Add exact error messages for more searchable resolution to issues.

## Articles to edit/revise
* Hyper-V on Windows [remote host management article](./virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/user_guide/remote_host_management.md)

## Articles to add
* Get started guides for:
  * cri/containerd
  * runhcs
* README for all Container samples and tools
* README for all Hyper-V samples and tools

## Doc structure and functionality
* Move Hyper-V server to virtualization docs
  *	Consolidate and cross ref where possible to Hyper-V for Win 10.
 * Move blog to docs
  * Investigate making a template for a new docs in a file so when people go to add a new blog, it autopopulates the TOC + metadata and such.  Maybe a ‚Äúcreate blog‚Äù button üòä.  I think this is the biggest barrier to blog in docs.
