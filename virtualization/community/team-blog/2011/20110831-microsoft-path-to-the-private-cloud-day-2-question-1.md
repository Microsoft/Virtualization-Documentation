Yesterday we kicked off the “[Microsoft Path to the Private Cloud”](http://bit.ly/q1kpZg) Contest, read official [rules](http://bit.ly/pGlJmT).  As of the posting of this blog, we still have not received a tweet with the winning answers.  That means there are still two Xboxes on the table. But we're keeping things moving and today is the final day of the contest so see below for first question in the series of three for the day. A reminder on how the contest works: We’ll be posting three (3) questions related to Microsoft’s virtualization, system management and private cloud offerings today (8/31), one per hour from 9:00 a.m. – 11:00 a.m. PST.  You’ll be able to find the answers on the [Microsoft.com](http://bit.ly/roPfDJ) sites.  Once you have the answers to all three questions, you send us single Twitter message (direct tweet) with all three answers to the questions to the [@MSServerCloud](http://bit.ly/ouOZlj) Twitter handle.  The person that sends us the first Twitter message with all three correct answers in it will win an Xbox 360 4GB Kinect Game Console bundle for the day. And the 8/31, 9 am. Question is: Q: Which Microsoft offering provides deep visibility into the health, performance and availability of your datacenter, private cloud and public cloud environments (such as Windows Azure) – across applications, operating systems, hypervisors and even hardware – through a single, familiar and easy to use interface? 

Let the contest begin!!  Remember to gather all three answers before you direct tweet us the message. Be sure to check back here at 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. PST as well for the next two questions.
