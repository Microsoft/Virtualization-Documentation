As we announced yesterday we are proud to have [NetApp and Cisco](http://blogs.technet.com/b/virtualization/archive/2011/05/16/new-hyper-v-cloud-fast-track-partners-double-down-on-private-cloud-vision.aspx) participating in the [Hyper-V Cloud Fast Track](http://www.microsoft.com/virtualization/en/us/hyperv-cloud-fasttrack.aspx) program and delivering pre-validated private cloud solutions for customers. The new [NetApp Hyper-V Cloud Fast Track with Cisco](https://www.netapp.com/microsoftcloud) builds upon the [reference architecture](http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/7/9/B7931A5A-18F6-41EA-B603-975EF281587F/Hyper-V_Cloud_Fast_Track_White_Paper.pdf) and layers on the additional capabilities inherent in the NetApp and Cisco infrastructure.  This joint solution exemplifies a key tenet of Fast Track which is the extensible nature of the architecture.    Check out what [NetApp](http://blogs.netapp.com/msenviro/2011/05/netapp-hyperv-cloud-fast-track-with-cisco.html) is saying about this solution as well as [Cisco](http://blogs.cisco.com/category/datacenter/).  _If you happen to be at Tech Ed_ , Alex Jauch from NetApp, will be demonstrating some of the capabilities of their offering in Bryon Surace’s VIR327 session on Hyper-V Cloud Fast Track on Tuesday morning at 10:15 to 11:30 in Room B211 – hope to see you there.
