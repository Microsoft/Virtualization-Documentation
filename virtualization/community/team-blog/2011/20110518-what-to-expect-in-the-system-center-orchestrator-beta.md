Hi everyone

Today at TechEd North America we disclosed a lot of information about, and took System Center Orchestrator for a spin in itâ€™s first public outing!

I have posted an article over on the Orchestrator Blog site with the details about the Beta and what to expect. You can view the article here [**http://blogs.technet.com/b/scorch/archive/2011/05/17/what-to-expect-in-the-system-center-orchestrator-beta.aspx**](http://blogs.technet.com/b/scorch/archive/2011/05/17/what-to-expect-in-the-system-center-orchestrator-beta.aspx)

In addition, we will be running an Evaluation Program as announced [**here**](http://blogs.technet.com/b/systemcenter/archive/2011/05/16/community-evaluation-program-now-accepting-applications.aspx). If you fill out the form for the [**Orchestrator CEP**](https://connect.microsoft.com/site1211/Survey/Survey.aspx?SurveyID=12773) you will not only be part of the program which includes guided tours of the new features, ready made environments and calls with the Product Group, but you will also be notified the minute that the Beta is available to download!

We look forward to engaging with you in the Evaluation Program.

Adam
