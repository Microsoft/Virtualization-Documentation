Starting next week on August 30th at 9:00 a.m. PST, we’re kicking off our  
Microsoft Path to the Private Cloud Contest. During the contest you’ll have the

management and private cloud offerings by being the first to provide the  
correct answers to three questions posted daily on the [Microsoft Server and Cloud Platform blog](http://bit.ly/o1zBkP).
