  **Applicable Linux Distributions**   Microsoft provides Linux Integration Services for a broad range of Linux distros as documented in the “[Linux and FreeBSD Virtual Machines on Hyper-V](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn531030\(ws.12\).aspx)” topic on TechNet. Per that documentation, many Linux distributions and versions have Linux Integration Services built-in and do not require installation of this separate LIS package from Microsoft. This LIS package is available for a subset of supported distributions in order to provide the best performance and fullest use of Hyper-V features. It can be installed in the listed distribution versions that do not already have LIS built, and can be installed as an upgrade in listed distribution versions that already have LIS built in. LIS 4.1 is applicable to the following guest operating systems: 

  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2-5.11 32-bit, 32-bit PAE, and 64-bit
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0-6.7 32-bit and 64-bit
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0-7.2 64-bit
  * CentOS 5.2-5.11 32-bit, 32-bit PAE, and 64-bit
