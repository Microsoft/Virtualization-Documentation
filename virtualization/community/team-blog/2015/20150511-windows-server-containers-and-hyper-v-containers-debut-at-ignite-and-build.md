Build and Ignite were packed with information about Windows Server Containers (announced in October) and Hyper-V Containers (announced in April).  We also launched the official Windows containers documentation site here:  
[https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/](https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/)  
Ignite and Build sessions as well as Channel9 interviews are available on the front page and in the Community section.   Keep checking back in for the latest announcements, community tools, and information as we move forward. Right now you can read about Windows containers, the container ecosystem, and our most frequently asked questions. Cheers,
