We are excited to see [the release of XenDesktop 7](http://www.citrix.com/news/announcements/may-2013/citrix-extends-enterprise-mobility-strategy-with-xendesktop-7.html) and support our partner Citrix. XenDesktop 7 brings together both XenApp and XenDesktop functionality into a common release and now brings support for Windows Server 2012.  XenDesktop can easily be deployed on [Hyper-V](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/windows-server/server-virtualization.aspx?WT.mc_id=BlogVirt_HyperV_WS2012) and take full advantage of Windows Server 2012 to increase agility, reduce cost, and provide a scalable and robust platform for desktop virtualization.
