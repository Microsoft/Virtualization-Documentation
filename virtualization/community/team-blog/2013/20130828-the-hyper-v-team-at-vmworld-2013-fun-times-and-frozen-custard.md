Many VMworld 2013 attendees looked at Hyper-V a long time ago, and haven’t kept up with the progress our platform has made in recent years. If you count yourself among this group, we at Microsoft would love to show you how far we’ve come. However, you needn’t take my word for it – I encourage you to find out for yourself. The Hyper-V team took their message and information to VMworld 2013 in a fun and creative way. Varun Chhabra, Senior Product Marketing Manager, Server and Tools blogs about the experience in “[Planes, trucks and frozen custard - The Hyper-V Team at VMworld 2013](http://blogs.technet.com/b/windowsserver/archive/2013/08/28/planes-trucks-and-frozen-custard-the-hyper-v-team-at-vmworld-2013.aspx)” where he had the opportunity to talk with customers, potential customers, and members of the VMWare staff.  It is an insightful view.  Check it out!
