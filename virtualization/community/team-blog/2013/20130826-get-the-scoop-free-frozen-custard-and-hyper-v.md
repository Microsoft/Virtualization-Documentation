Research shows that over 70% of businesses now have more than one virtualization platform in their IT environment. As you can imagine, this trend is opening up opportunities for IT professionals that are familiar with more than one virtualization platform. And if you look at the market data, it is clear that Hyper-V is the one to watch (and try!) .

Sound interesting? Get more information on our activities at VMworld 2013 from Microsoft Senior PMM Varun Chhabra in his post, “[Get the “Scoop” on Hyper-V During VMworld](http://blogs.technet.com/b/windowsserver/archive/2013/08/26/get-the-scoop-on-hyper-v-during-vmworld.aspx)”.
