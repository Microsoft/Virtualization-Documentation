 For you channel partners out there, if you don't know about the Microsoft and Citrix V-Alliance, then speak with either your Microsoft or Citrix contacts. The program is rolled out in Europe, is rolling out in the U.S., and will kick-off soon in Asia. The website is [here](http://www.v-alliance.net/index.aspx).  Here's a brief video that I recorded with Citrix's Klaus Oestermann today from VMworld Europe 2010. If you're a channel partner in Copenhagen, and want to learn more, stop by MIcrosoft booth #69, Citrix booth #80, or tonight at the Microsoft Tweetup [here](http://twtvite.com/msvirt). [note: O’Learys Sports Bar is in Copenhagen’s Central Station. On S Train route maps, look for København H, which is Central Station. Once you’ve arrive Central Station, O’Learys is in the far corner on the right when you enter the main hall from the train platforms. [View:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpLmj4-lfAg]
