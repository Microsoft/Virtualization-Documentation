> **Abstract:**
> 
> Many customers are making the decision every ** __** day to move away from their high-priced VMware Infrastructure to a dynamic infrastructure using Microsoft’s virtualization technology. They know the quality and capabilities of Microsoft Virtualization give them the platform they need, they just don’t know how to do it. There is a way to migrate from VMware, and a coexistence strategy during the transition is essential. Hear Microsoft’s vision and guidance when moving from a VMware infrastructure to Microsoft Virtualization, and in a real-time demo, watch how Microsoft can assist you in managing both your VMware and Microsoft environments. This session is also designed to hear your feedback and get your ideas on this popular topic.
