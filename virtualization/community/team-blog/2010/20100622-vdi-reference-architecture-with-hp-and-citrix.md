At [HP's Tech Forum conference](http://h30406.www3.hp.com/campaigns/2010/events/hptechforum/index.php "HP Tech Forum website"), HP started to market a VDI reference architecture, and deployment offer,Â with us and Citrix. The brochure can be seen [here](http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetPDF.aspx/4AA2-1061ENW.pdf "HP brochure on VDI ref architecture"). The VDI offer can be seen [here](http://www.citrixandmicrosoft.com/ "VDI offer site"). The nuts and bolts of the architecture includes: 

  * HP ProLiant BL460c server blades
  * HP StorageWorks P4800 SAN
  * HP Insight Control for System Center
  * Citrix XenDesktop 4.0 enterprise edition
  * Hyper-V R2

There are new HP infrastructure services for VDI to help you get started. HP's Dave Donatelli spoke of this VDI architecture (and more) toward the end of [his keynote today](http://h18004.www1.hp.com/products/solutions/whatsnew.html "HP Tech Forum keynote on June 22"). It starts around 1:08:00 of Donatelli's keynote.
