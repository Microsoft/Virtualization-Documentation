Hello all,

 

I’m Paul Despe and I work as a program manager on the Microsoft Hyper-V team.

 

Until now, Hyper-V administrators using Server Core installs of Windows Server 2008 or Microsoft Hyper-V Server were unable to enable and disable protocol bindings from the parent partition due to the lack of a graphical network control panel only available in full installs of Windows Server.

 

I'm pleased to announce one of our developers on the Hyper-V team, Keith Mange, recently addressed this gap with the release of his (previously Microsoft internal-only) networking tool NVSPBIND.EXE publicly on. See it [here](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/nvspbind "tool on MSDN").

This command line tool gives users easier granular control over network items they want enabled for their physical NICs and helps fills a gap in troubleshooting, optimizing and hardening networking configurations on Server Core installs or Hyper-V Server.

 

See John Howard’s blog [[here](http://blogs.technet.com/jhoward/archive/2010/01/25/announcing-nvspbind.aspx "John Howard blog")] for more details:
