Starting in the latest Insider's build, you can resize the display for a session in Virtual Machine Connection just by dragging the corner of the window. [![dynamic_resize](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/01/dynamic_resize.gif)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/01/dynamic_resize.gif) When you connect to a VM, you'll still see the normal options which determine the size of the window and the resolution to pass to the virtual machine: [![vmconnectclassic](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/01/vmconnectCLASSIC.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/01/vmconnectCLASSIC.png) Once you log in, you can see that the guest OS is using the specified resolution, in this case 1366 x 768.

Neat!

If I change my scaling factor on the host, the VM display will scale as well. There are 2 requirements for dynamic resizing to work: 

  * You must be running in **Enhanced session mode**
  * You must be fully **logged in** to the guest OS (it won't work on the lockscreen)

  This remains a work in progress, so we would love to hear your thoughts. -Andy
