I was playing with Windows 10’s on screen keyboard and discovered the emoticons section. Specifically, I found this awesome set of cat emojis. [![clip_image001\[10\]](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/02/clip_image00110_thumb.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/02/clip_image00110.png) WindowsKitty definitely needed to be a VM Name. It even has a laptop! Luckily, it turns out, the Quick Create option we added recently handles emoji beautifully. [![clip_image001\[5\]](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/02/clip_image0015_thumb.png)](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/2017/02/clip_image0015.png) Not only does the VM name look great in Quick Create with the crazy Windows 10 emoji, Windows also splices them into simpler Unicode representations for Hyper-V Manager and the file system. I was really enjoying seeing what the simplified Unicode would be – in this case, cat + computer.

In conclusion, if you don’t need PowerShell scripting (or love referencing VMs via GUID) maybe emoji names are for you. It makes me smile, at least.
