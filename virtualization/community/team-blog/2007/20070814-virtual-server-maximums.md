# Virtual Server Maximums

Virtualization Nation,

In my last blog, I discussed the fact that with Virtual Server R2 SP1 we increased the amount of physical memory that Virtual Server can address from 64 GB to 256 GB. I saw that this prompted questions about other maximums for storage, networking, etc, so I thought I’d provide a table with more details for Virtual Server.

If you’re like most folks who are using virtualization for server consolidation, you’ll see that Virtual Server provides plenty of capabilities for production environments. In fact, our own Microsoft IT uses Virtual Server with over 1200+ virtual machines _in production environments every day_. For more information on how our own Microsoft IT has deployed over 1200 virtual machines in production environments go here.

Cheers,  
Jeff
