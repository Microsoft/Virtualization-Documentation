# Installing Virtual Server R2 SP1 on Windows Server 2008 Beta 3

Virtualization Nation,

If you’re trying to run Virtual Server R2 SP1 on Window Server 2008 Beta 3, it does work. However, there are three steps for success.

You need to:

1. Add the IIS role with the correct settings for Virtual Server.
2. Install Virtual Server R2 SP1.
3. Run IE elevated as an Administrator to access the Virtual Server Administration Page. To run IE elevated, right click on IE and select **Run as Administrator**. (BTW: If you don’t do this, IE will quit with an error. This is a known issue and a fix is being investigated.)

Since the first step, adding the IIS role, requires specific settings to be enabled, I thought I’d cover this first step in detail. The second and third steps are straightforward and require nothing special.  So, below I’ve provided step-by-step instructions for configuring IIS, the correct settings and included screen shots.

These installation instructions are for running Virtual Server R2 SP1 on a full installation of Windows Server 2008 Beta 3, not a server core installation. I'll cover that in a future blog.

Cheers,  
Jeff
