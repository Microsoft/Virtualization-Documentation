We have seen multiple queries on the steps required to create the Hyper-V Replica Broker using Powershell, a [previous post](http://blogs.technet.com/b/virtualization/archive/2012/03/27/why-is-the-quot-hyper-v-replica-broker-quot-required.aspx) describes the process but adding more details on the end to end workflow.

To create a Hyper-V Replica Broker in a DHCP environment, use the following cmdlets:
    
    
       1: #Specify the name for the Broker and static IP address
    
    
       2: $BrokerName = "ReplicaBroker"
    
    
       3:   
    
    
       4: #These are derived parameters and need not be specified
    
    
       5: $BrokerResourceName = "Virtual Machine Replication Broker"
    
    
       6: $TempBrokerGroupName = $BrokerName + "Group"
    
    
       7:   
    
    
       8: #Creating a cluster server role to create the Broker CAP
    
    
       9: Add-ClusterServerRole -Name $BrokerName | Out-Null
    
    
      10:   
    
    
      11: #Creating Hyper-V Replica Broker Group using WMI
    
    
      12: ([wmiclass]"root\MSCluster:MSCluster_ResourceGroup").CreateGroup($TempBrokerGroupName, 115) | Out-Null
    
    
      13: Add-ClusterResource -Name $BrokerResourceName -Group $TempBrokerGroupName -ResourceType "Virtual Machine Replication Broker" | Out-Null
    
    
      14:   
    
    
      15: #Moving the Broker CAP to the right group"
    
    
      16: Move-ClusterResource -name $BrokerName  -Group $TempBrokerGroupName | Out-Null 
    
    
      17: Add-ClusterResourceDependency  $BrokerResourceName $BrokerName | Out-Null
    
    
      18:   
    
    
      19: #Moving the temoporary group used to create the Broker CAP"
    
    
      20: Remove-ClusterGroup -name  $BrokerName -RemoveResources -Force | Out-Null
    
    
      21:   
    
    
      22: #Rename cluster group to get parity in name between the group and CAP"
    
    
      23: Get-ClusterGroup $TempBrokerGroupName | %{ $_.Name = $BrokerName }
    
    
      24:   
    
    
      25: #Starting Hyper-V Replica Broker Resource"
    
    
      26: Start-ClusterGroup -Name $BrokerName | Out-Null

To specify a static IP address for the Hyper-V Replica Broker, specify the IP address in the StaticAddress parameter of the [Add-ClusterServerRole](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee461053)
    
    
       1: #Specify the name for the Broker and static IP address
    
    
       2: $BrokerName = "ReplicaBroker"
    
    
       3: $IPAddressOfBroker = "172.22.57.87"
    
    
       4:   
    
    
       5: #These are derived parameters and need not be specified
    
    
       6: $BrokerResourceName = "Virtual Machine Replication Broker"
    
    
       7: $TempBrokerGroupName = $BrokerName + "Group"
    
    
       8:   
    
    
       9: #Creating a cluster server role to create the Broker CAP
    
    
      10: Add-ClusterServerRole -Name $BrokerName -StaticAddress $IPAddressOfBroker | Out-Null
    
    
      11:   
    
    
      12: #Creating Hyper-V Replica Broker Group using WMI
    
    
      13: ([wmiclass]"root\MSCluster:MSCluster_ResourceGroup").CreateGroup($TempBrokerGroupName, 115) | Out-Null
    
    
      14: Add-ClusterResource -Name $BrokerResourceName -Group $TempBrokerGroupName -ResourceType "Virtual Machine Replication Broker" | Out-Null
    
    
      15:   
    
    
      16: #Moving the Broker CAP to the right group"
    
    
      17: Move-ClusterResource -name $BrokerName  -Group $TempBrokerGroupName | Out-Null 
    
    
      18: Add-ClusterResourceDependency  $BrokerResourceName $BrokerName | Out-Null
    
    
      19:   
    
    
      20: #Moving the temoporary group used to create the Broker CAP"
    
    
      21: Remove-ClusterGroup -name  $BrokerName -RemoveResources -Force | Out-Null
    
    
      22:   
    
    
      23: #Rename cluster group to get parity in name between the group and CAP"
    
    
      24: Get-ClusterGroup $TempBrokerGroupName | %{ $_.Name = $BrokerName }
    
    
      25:   
    
    
      26: #Starting Hyper-V Replica Broker Resource"
    
    
      27: Start-ClusterGroup -Name $BrokerName | Out-Null

Once the Hyper-V Replica Broker is created, enable the cluster to receive replication traffic by using the [Set-VMReplicationServer](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848598) cmdlet.
