Many of you will be interested to learn more about forthcoming lab management capabilities in Visual Studio Team System 2010. Or you may have lunch or meetings with a dev who _you_ _want_ to know more about VSTS 2010 Lab Management. That last part is a nod to ["that darn reality" post](http://blogs.computerworld.com/that_darn_reality "ComputerWorld's sharktank") at SharkTank. So check the [VSTS Lab Management team blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/lab_management/default.aspx "VSTS Lab Management team blog").
