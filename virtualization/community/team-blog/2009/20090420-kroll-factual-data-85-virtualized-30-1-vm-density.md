You may have never heard of Kroll Factual Data. But ever since personal credit became harder to acquire, lenders held tighter to their money, and interest rates went up/down like a roller coaster, Kroll has been on a wild ride of their own. In short, Kroll Factual Data offers business information to mortgage lenders, consumer lenders, property management firms and the federal government. So when Ben Bernanke of the Federal Reserve speaks, Kroll often sees the volume of demand for their services increase or decrease.

Chris Steffen of Kroll has [posted guest blogs](http://blogs.technet.com/virtualization/archive/2009/02/04/guest-post-the-green-benefits-we-ve-experienced-with-a-virtualized-data-center.aspx "Chris Steffen blog") to this site before, and will be speaking on an webcast April 28 ([register here](http://www2.eventsvc.com/academylive/register/c9fee1c9-b5ce-4349-a3f6-82858e358aa5 "Webcast reg page")). I first met Chris at VMworld 2007 in San Francisco. At the time he was using MS Virtual Server, SCVMM v1 wasn't fully deployed yet and he was waiting for Hyper-V to be released. At the time (Sept 2007), Kroll had 75% of their production servers virtualized, were processing 200,000-250,000 transactions a day, and were managing 1,400 virtual machines. That was amazing at that time. But nothing compared to what Kroll does today.

See the news release [here](http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2009/apr09/04-20KrollGreenPR.mspx "MSFT news release") about Kroll Factual Data. A few highlights:
