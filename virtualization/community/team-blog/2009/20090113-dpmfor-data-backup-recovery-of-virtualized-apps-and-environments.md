We want to congratulate the Microsoft Storage Solutions team for releasing Service Pack 1 for System Center Data Protection Manager 2007.

 

SP1 for DPM 2007 brings some great new capabilities for protecting Hyper-V environments.  Most notably, of course, is the ability to protect guests within Hyper-V environments, often without downtime (for those guests running a Windows operating system that supports VSS).  Also new for DPM with SP1 is the ability to run the DPM server on the Hyper-V host itself, so that the DPM server can protect the guests from the host viewpoint, within the same physical server - to disk, to tape and even to the cloud. 

And unlike other (shall-not-be-named) virtualization platforms’ backup mechanisms, DPM does _not_ require a SAN and does _not_ require 3rd party backup software or add-ons.   It’s an all Microsoft backup and recovery solution for Microsoft’s virtualization platform.

Congrats to the DPM crew – and nice job on backing up Hyper-V !!!
