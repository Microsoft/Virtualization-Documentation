Ordinarily it'd be  **great** news that we RTM'd System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 R2 ahead of schedule, so close to the RTM of WS08 R2 Hyper-V and one week before VMworld conference. You can't beat the timing of it all. And the ~10,000 beta testers  of SCVMM08 R2 are a big part of why we were able to deliver a high-quality release in the time we did.  Some of the early adopters included Continental Airlines, Lionbridge Techologies, Sporton, Indiana University Auxilary IT and MaximumASP. Thanks to all! But unfortunately, next week at VMworld 2009 we can't show SCVMM 2008 R2, or any other products, in our booth. You've probably [read](http://www.virtualization.info/2009/08/hello-freedom-vmware-adds-more.html "Virtualization.info") about it. In short, it's their show, it's not an industry show, and they set the rules. So we'll make the best of it; always lots of Microsoft customers and partners on the floor. Stop by the booth to meet some of the best/brightest minds at Microsoft. As for the RTM of SCVMM 2008 R2, Zane summarizes his thoughts [here](http://blogs.technet.com/systemcenter/archive/2009/08/24/system-center-virtual-machine-manager-vmm-2008-r2-rtms.aspx "Nexus/System Center team blog"). Kerim blogged about upgrade path to R2 from SCVMM 2008. See [here](http://blogs.technet.com/chengw/archive/2009/08/24/vmm-2008-r2-upgrade-guide.aspx "Cheng's blog"). And on May 11, Vishhwa provided some details on features of SCVMM 2008 R2 [here](http://blogs.technet.com/scvmm/archive/2009/05/11/scvmm-r2-rc-features.aspx "SCVMM blog"). 

As Cheng wrote in his blog (I can't say it any better)
