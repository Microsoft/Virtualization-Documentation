I'm a bit behind is sharing the following demo video. On Tuesday at Microsoft Management Summit, we did a demo of application virtualization for servers. Both [Mary Jo](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=2506 "Mary Jo Foley blog post") and [Alessandro](http://www.virtualization.info/2009/04/microsoft-confirms-app-v-for-servers-in.html "Alessandro's blog post") predicted this demo a couple weeks ago - so not a real surprise. The demo was described as a technology preview, meaning there's no plan of record for beta testing date. So what did Bill Morein demo?

As you'll see, Bill's demo was setup by talk about administering the compute fabric and managing deployment of a tightly bound OS can create challenges. By applying application virtualization to this challenge, we can separate apps from the server. This should mean a more simplified, and accelerated, approach to deploying those virtualized apps and patching. Bill pointed out that this leads to reduce image libraries, and accelerated migration. 

Check out the demo - it's less than 6 minutes.
