Admittedly this post is a stew and not a meal (if that metaphor works). But you might be interested in the following items. I'll keep it short: 

  * John Kelbley will host a webcast on Friday, May 8 at 8:00am PDT titled, "Running Linux on Hyper-V." The session will discuss install, configure, run, backup and monitor non-Windows systems. See [here](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032415500&Culture=en-US "TechNet webcast").
  * On May 14, 8am-noon PDT, Edwin Yuen will host a live chat on TechTarget. He'll answer questions about our virt products, be it datacenter, desktop or managemment. See more [here](http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/microsoft-virtualization-chat/ "TechTarget chat site").
  * Wondering what to read when you're flying to TechEd, or your next trip? The Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V Resource Kit [book](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/Books/11842.aspx "MS Learning site") is it. One of the authors, Robert Larson, architect in MS Services and [TechNet blogger](http://blogs.technet.com/roblarson/ "Robert Larson blog"), told me that the book is in final formatting and some sample chapters are available to download ([here](http://doingitvirtual.com/media/15/default.aspx "Chapter downloads")). The book will be available via Amazon and Barnes and Noble in June. Read more from one of the authors [here](http://doingitvirtual.com/blogs/virtualzone/archive/2009/04/28/download-samples-of-the-ms-press-windows-server-2008-hyper-v-resource-kit.aspx "Doing IT Virtual blog").
  * Finally 

Enjoy. 

Patrick
