Virtualization affects how we plan, build, deploy, operate, and _service_ workloads.   Customers are creating large libraries of virtual machines containing various configurations.  The patch-state of these virtual machines are not always known.  Ensuring that offline virtual machines are properly patched and won’t become vulnerable the instant they come online is critical. 

 

I am therefore very pleased to state that the Offline Virtual Machine Servicing Tool v2.1 has now been released! 

 

Congratulations to the Solution Accelerator team for this release! 

 

The **[Offline Virtual Machine Servicing Tool 2.1](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc501231.aspx)** has free, tested guidance and automated tools to help customers keep their virtualized machines updated, without introducing vulnerabilities into their IT infrastructure.   

 

The tool combines the Windows Workflow programming model with the Windows PowerShell interface to automatically bring groups of virtual machines online, service them with the latest security updates, and return them to an offline state. 

 

 **What ’s New?

Release 2.1 is a direct response to customer and Microsoft field requests to support the R2 wave.  Offline Virtual Machine Servicing Tool 2.1 now supports the following products:
