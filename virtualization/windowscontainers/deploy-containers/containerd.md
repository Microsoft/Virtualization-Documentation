# Container platform tools on Windows

To make container management tools consistent across Windows and Linux with as little operating system specific integration work as possible, we're introducing a Windows counterpart to runc - [runhcs](https://github.com/Microsoft/hcsshim/tree/master/cmd/runhcs).  We have also worked closely with the containerd project to integrate runhcs into [containerd/containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) and [containerd/cri](https://github.com/containerd/cri).

This article will talk about the Windows and Linux container platform, `runhcs`, HCS (Host Compute Service), and `containerd` on Windows.

## Windows and Linux container platform

In Linux environments, container management tools like Docker are built on another, more granular, set of container tools - [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) and [containerd](https://containerd.io/).

`runc` is a Linux command line tool for creating and running containers according to the [OCI container runtime specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec).

`containerd` is a daemon that manages container life cycle from downloading and unpacking the container image through container execution and supervision.

On Windows, we initially took a different approach.  When we started working with Docker to support Windows containers, we built directly on the HCS (Host Compute Service).  [This blog post](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/virtualization/2017/01/27/introducing-the-host-compute-service-hcs/) is full of information about why we built the HCS and why we took this approach to containers initially.

At this point, Docker still calls directly into the HCS. Going forward, however, container management tools could call into containerd and runhcs the way they call on containerd and runc on Linux.

## runhcs

RunHCS is a fork of runc.  Like runc, runhcs is a command line client for running applications packaged according to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format and is a compliant implementation of the Open Container Initiative specification.  The biggest difference between the two, besides running on Windows, is that runhcs can run both Windows and Linux [Hyper-V containers](../manage-containers/hyperv-container.md) in addition to Windows process containers.

Usage:

``` cmd
runhcs run [ -b bundle ] <container-id>
```

`<container-id>` is your name for the container instance you are starting. The name must be unique on your container host.

The bundle directory (using `-b bundle`) is optional.  
As with runc, containers are configured using bundles. A container's bundle is the directory with the container's OCI specification file, "config.json".  The default value for "bundle" is the current directory.

The OCI spec file, "config.json", has to have two fields to run correctly:

1. A path to the container's scratch space
1. A path to the container's layer directory

Container commands available in runhcs include:

* Tools to create and run a container
  * **run** creates and runs a container
  * **create** create a container

* Tools to manage processes running in a container:
  * **start** executes the user defined process in a created container
  * **exec** runs a new process inside the container
  * **pause** pause suspends all processes inside the container
  * **resume** resumes all processes that have been previously paused
  * **ps** ps displays the processes running inside a container

* Tools to manage a container's state
  * **state** outputs the state of a container
  * **kill** sends the specified signal (default: SIGTERM) to the container's init process
  * **delete** deletes any resources held by the container often used with detached container

The only command that could be considered multi-container is **list**.  It lists running (or paused) containers started by runhcs with the given root.

## containerd/cri

> !NOTE CRI support is only available in Server 2019/Windows 10 1809 and later.

While OCI specs defines a single container, CRI (container runtime interface) describes containers as workload(s) in a shared sandbox environment called a pod.  Pods can containe one or more container workloads.  Pods let container orchestrators like Kubernetes and Service Fabric Mesh handle grouped worloads that should be on the same host with some shared resources such as memory and vNETs.

Links to the CRI spec:
* [RunPodSandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/apis/cri/runtime/v1alpha2/api.proto#L24) - Pod Spec
* [CreateContainer](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/apis/cri/runtime/v1alpha2/api.proto#L47) - Workload Spec

![Containerd based container environments](media/containerd-platform.png)

While runHCS and containerd both can manage on any Windows system Server 2016 or later, supporting Pods (groups of containers) required breaking changes to container tools in Windows.  CRI support is available on Windows Server 2019/Windows 10 1809 and later.

## HCS

We have two wrappers available on GitHub to interface with the HCS. Since the HCS is a C API, wrappers make it easy to call the HCS from higher level languages.  

### HCSShim

HCSShim is written in Go and it's the basis for runhcs.
Grab the latest from AppVeyor or build it yourself.

Check it out in [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/hcsshim).

### dotnet-computevirtualization

dotnet-computevirtualization is a C# wrapper for the HCS.

Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-computevirtualization).

If you want to use the HCS (either directly or via a wrapper), or you want to make a Rust/Haskell/InsertYourLanguage wrapper around the HCS, please leave a comment.

For a deeper look at the HCS, watch [John Starkâ€™s DockerCon presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85nCF5S8Qok).
