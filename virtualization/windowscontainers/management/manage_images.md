# Container Images

**This is preliminary content and subject to change.** 

Container images are used to deploy containers. These images can include an operating system, applications, and all application dependencies. For instance, you may develop a container image that has been pre-configured with Nano Server, IIS, and an application running in IIS. This container image can then be stored in a container registry for later use, deployed on any Windows Container host (on-prem, cloud, or even to a container service), and also used as the base for a new container image.

There are two types of container images:

- Base OS Images – these are provided by Microsoft and include the core OS components. 
- Container Images – a container image that has been created from a Base OS Image.

**Using the Install-ContainerImage cmdlet installs a BASE OS image for use in either PowerShell or Docker managed containers.  If you download a BASE OS image and it does not show up under Docker after downloading.  Restart the Docker service using the services control panel applet or the command 'sc docker stop' and then 'sc docker start'

## PowerShell

### List Images <!--1-->

Run `get-containerImage` to return a list of images on the container host. The container image type is differentiated when with the `IsOSImage` property.

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-ContainerImage

Name              		Publisher    	Version      	IsOSImage
----              		---------    	-------      	---------
NanoServer        		CN=Microsoft 	10.0.10586.0 	True
WindowsServerCore 		CN=Microsoft 	10.0.10586.0 	True
WindowsServerCoreIIS 	CN=Demo   		1.0.0.0 		False

```

### Installing Base OS Images

Container OS images can be found and installed using the ContainerProvider PowerShell module. Before using this module, it will need to be installed. The following commands can be used to install the module.

```powershell
PS C:\> Install-PackageProvider ContainerProvider -Force
```

Return a list of images from PowerShell OneGet package manager:
```powershell
PS C:\> Find-ContainerImage

Name                 Version                 Description
----                 -------                 -----------
NanoServer           10.0.10586.0            Container OS Image of Windows Server 2016 Techn...
WindowsServerCore    10.0.10586.0            Container OS Image of Windows Server 2016 Techn...
```

To download and install the Nano Server base OS image, run the following. The `-version` parameter is optional. Without a base OS image version specified, the latest version will be installed.

```powershell
PS C:\> Install-ContainerImage -Name NanoServer -Version 10.0.10586.0

Downloaded in 0 hours, 0 minutes, 10 seconds.
```

Likewaise, this command will download and install the Windows Server Core base OS image. The `-version` parameter is optional. Without a base OS image version specified, the latest version will be installed.

> **Issue** Save-ContainerImage and Install-ContainerImage cmdlets fail to work with a WindowsServerCore container image in a PowerShell remoting session. **Workaround:** Logon to the machine using Remote Desktop and use Save-ContainerImage cmdlet directly.

```powershell
PS C:\> Install-ContainerImage -Name WindowsServerCore -Version 10.0.10586.0

Downloaded in 0 hours, 2 minutes, 28 seconds.
```

Verify that the images have been installed using the `Get-ContainerImage` command.

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-ContainerImage

Name              Publisher    Version      IsOSImage
----              ---------    -------      ---------
NanoServer        CN=Microsoft 10.0.10586.0 True
WindowsServerCore CN=Microsoft 10.0.10586.0 True
```  
For more information on Container image management see [Windows Container Images](../management/manage_images.md).

### Creating New Image <!--1-->

```powershell
PS C:\> New-ContainerImage -Container $container -Publisher Demo -Name DemoImage -Version 1.0
```

### Removing Image <!--1-->

Container images cannot be removed if any container, even in a stopped state, has a dependency on the image.

Remove a single image with PowerShell. 

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-ContainerImage -Name newimage | Remove-ContainerImage -Force
```

### Image Dependency <!--1-->

When a new image is created, it becomes dependent on the image that it was created from. This dependency can be seen using the `get-containerimage` command. If a parent image is not listed, this indicates that the image is a Base OS image.

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-ContainerImage | select Name, ParentImage

Name              ParentImage
----              -----------
NanoServerIIS     ContainerImage (Name = 'NanoServer') [Publisher = 'CN=Microsoft', Version = '10.0.10586.0']
NanoServer
WindowsServerCore
```

## Docker

### List Images <!--2-->

```powershell
C:\> docker images

REPOSITORY             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              VIRTUAL SIZE
windowsservercoreiis   latest              ca40b33453f8        About a minute ago   44.88 MB
windowsservercore      10.0.10586.0        6801d964fda5        2 weeks ago          0 B
nanoserver             10.0.10586.0        8572198a60f1        2 weeks ago          0 B
```

### Creating New Image <!--2-->

```powershell
C:\> docker commit 475059caef8f windowsservercoreiis

ca40b33453f803bb2a5737d4d5dd2f887d2b2ad06b55ca681a96de8432b5999d
```

### Removing Image <!--2-->

Container images cannot be removed if any container, even in a stopped state, has a dependency on the image.

When removing an image with docker, the images can be referenced by image name or id.

```powershell
C:\> docker rmi windowsservercoreiis

Untagged: windowsservercoreiis:latest
Deleted: ca40b33453f803bb2a5737d4d5dd2f887d2b2ad06b55ca681a96de8432b5999d
```

### Docker Hub

The Docker Hub registry contains pre-built images which can be downloaded onto a container host. Once these images have been downloaded, they can be used as the base for Windows Container Applications.

To see a list of images available from Docker Hub use the `docker search` command. Note – the Windows Serve Core Base OS Image will need to be installed before pulling images dependent on Windows Server Core from Docker Hub.

```powershell
C:\> docker search *

```
Note – the images that start with "nano-" are for Nano Server containers.

To download an image from Docker Hub, use `docker pull`.

```powershell
C:\> docker pull microsoft/aspnet

Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from microsoft/aspnet
f9e8a4cc8f6c: Pull complete

b71a5b8be5a2: Download complete
```

The image will now be visible when running `docker images`.

```powershell
C:\> docker images

REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
microsoft/aspnet    latest              b3842ee505e5        5 hours ago         101.7 MB
windowsservercore   10.0.10586.0        6801d964fda5        2 weeks ago         0 B
windowsservercore   latest              6801d964fda5        2 weeks ago         0 B
```

### Image Dependency <!--2-->

To see image dependencies with Docker, the `docker history` command can be used.

```powershell
C:\> docker history windowsservercoreiis

IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY          SIZE                COMMENT
