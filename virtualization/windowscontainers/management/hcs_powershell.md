# Management Interoperability

**This is preliminary content and subject to change.** 

For the most part, Windows Containers created with PowerShell need to be managed with PowerShell and those created with Docker need to be managed with Docker. That said, the Host Computing PowerShell module provides the ability to discover and stop **running** containers, regardless of how they have been created. This module performs like a 'task manager' for containers running on a container host.

## Display all Containers

To return a list of containers use the `Get-ComputeProcess` command.

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-ComputeProcess

Id                                                Name                                      Owner       Type
--                                                ----                                      -----       ----
2088E0FA-1F7C-44DE-A4BC-1E29445D082B              DEMO1                                     VMMS   Container
373959AC-1BFA-46E3-A472-D330F5B0446C              DEMO2                                     VMMS   Container
d273c80b6e.. 									  d273c80b6e.. 								docker Container
e49cd35542.. 									  e49cd35542.. 								docker Container
```

## Stop a Container

To stop a container regardless if it was created using PowerShell or Docker, use the `Stop-ComputeProcess` command.

> At the time of writing, the VMMS service will need to be restarted in order for the containers to be shown as stopped when using the `Get-Container` command.

```powershell
PS C:\> Stop-ComputeProcess -Id 2088E0FA-1F7C-44DE-A4BC-1E29445D082B -Force
```
