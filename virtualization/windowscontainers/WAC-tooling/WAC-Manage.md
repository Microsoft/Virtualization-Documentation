# Manage Container images on Windows Admin Center

This topic describes how to manage container images on Windows Admin Center. Container images are used to create new containers on Windows machines or other cloud services, such as Azure Kubernetes Service. For more information on Windows images, check out the [Container images overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/#container-images).

## Pull container images

After deploying a container host, the next loggical action is to pull (or download) container images so new containers can be created from said images. You can use Windows Admin Center to pull new container images by opening the Containers extension on your targeted container host, selecting Images on the left-hand side menu under Container Host and clicking Pull.

On the Pull menu you can provide the repository and tag for the image you want to pull. You can also select the option to pull all tagged images on that repository.

If the image you want to pull is on a private repository you can provide the username and passoword to authenticate against that repository. If your repository is hosted on Azure Container Registry you can use the native Azure authentication on Windows Admin Center to access the image. This requires the Windows Admin Center instance to be connected to Azure and authenticated with your Azure account. For more information on how to connect a Windows Admin Center instance to Azure, check out the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/azure/azure-integration).

If you are not certain which image to pull, Windows Admin Center also provides a list of common images available. You can expend the Common Windows images tab to see a list of base images that are commonly pulled. Select the image you want to pull and Windows Admin Center will fill out the repository and tag fields.

## Push container images

Once you have your own container image created, it's a good practice to push that image to a centralized repository to allow other container hosts or cloud services to pull the image.

On the Images tab in the Containers extension of Windows Admin Center, select the image you wan to push and click Push.

On the Push menu, you can change the image name and tag before pushing (uploading) it and select to either a generic reposiroty or a repository on Azure Container Registry. For a generic repository, you will need to provide a username and password. For Azure Container Registry, you can use the integrated authentication on Windows Admin Center. For Azure, you can also select which subscription and registry you want to push the image to.
