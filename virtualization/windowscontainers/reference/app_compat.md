# Application Compatability in Windows Containers

This is a preview.  While eventually application that runs on Windows should also run in a container, this is a good place to see our current application compatability status.

The sole purpose of this document is to share our experience.

Is something not on this list?  Let us know what fails and succeeds in your environment via [the forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowscontainers).

## Windows Server Containers

We have tried to running the following applications in a Windows Server Container.  These results do not guarantee that the application functions correctly.

## Hyper-V Containers

We have tried to running the following applications in a Hyper-V Container.  These results do not guarantee that the application works correctly.
